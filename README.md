### A Word on Performance
[Benchmark](https://alexcorvi.github.io/xwebdb/_benchmark/index.html)
XWebDB has a pretty good performance. It has the fastest insert, bulk-insert, update, delete, and read times even with large databases.

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/G26JVwr9/image.png" width="450px">
	<br>
	<br>
</p>

It's backed by a simple, yet efficient [caching mechanism](https://github.com/alexcorvi/xwebdb/blob/master/src/core/cache.ts), and a [custom data structure](https://github.com/alexcorvi/xwebdb/blob/master/src/core/dictionary.ts) (similar to sorted dictionary in C#) that has been designed to perform well on various data types and sizes.

However, it is important to note that achieving such high-performance results requires maintaining a complete copy of the database in memory. While this approach may seem unconventional, it poses no significant issues for the intended use cases of this database, particularly given today's standards. The memory footprint for storing 10,000 2KB documents is nearly 20MB, which is considered manageable.

#### Data Complexity
- Get `O(1)`
- Insert `O(log n)`
- Delete `O(log n)`

----

#### A word of caution
While XWebDB may appear to be a promising choice for your next project compared to other databases, it is essential to carefully weigh your decision. Other solutions have undergone rigorous testing, have been battle-tested, and enjoy robust support from larger communities. This is not to discourage you from using XWebDB; in fact, I am currently using it in multiple projects myself. However, it's important to acknowledge that XWebDB is a relatively new project. With time, it is expected to mature and improve. I hope that in the future, this cautionary section can be removed from the documentation. Until then, it is advisable to thoroughly consider your options before making a final decision.

## Quick start

### Installation
Install using npm
```
npm install xwebdb
```
You can also include the pre-built and minified file:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xwebdb/dist/xwebdb.min.js"></script>
```

### Database Creation & Configuration

```typescript
import {Database} from "xwebdb";
let db = new Database({
	// ref is the only required property of the configuration
	ref: 'mydatabase1'
});
```
The above example serves as a basic starting point, refer to [Configuration section below](#Configuration) for more elaborate example.

### Object Mapping

```typescript
import {Database, Doc} from "xwebdb";

class Person extends Doc {
	firstName: string = '';
	lastName: string = '';
	get fullName() {
		return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
	}
}

let db = new Database<Person>({
    ref: 'mydatabase1',
	model: Person
});
```

### Operations
```typescript
// creating
db.insert(Person.new({firstName: "Ali"}))
// finding
db.find({ firstName: "Ali" })
// using operators
db.find({ firstName: { $eq: "Ali" } })
// updating
db.update({{ firstName: "Ali" }}, {$set: { firstName: "Dina" }})
// deleting
db.delete({ firstName: { $eq: "Ali" } })
```
### Live Queries
```typescript
let res1 = await db.live({ firstName: "Ali" });
let res2 = await db.live({ firstName: "Ali" });
let res3 = await db.find({ firstName: "Ali" })
res1[0].firstName = 'Mario';
```
The last line of the above example updates the database in addition to `res1`. So it is equivalent to:
```
db.update({firstName: 'Ali'},{$set: firstName: 'Mario'})
```
Also, `res2` will have an updated value (automatically), but `res3` will have the old value since it has been called with `find` instead of `live`.

# Deep Dive
## Configuration
## Object Mapping
The advantages of defining a model:
- It will be considered as a schema for strict typing.
- `_id` field will be added automatically.
- You can set getters in the class and use them when querying.
- You can set default values for properties.
- Properties with default values will be stripped on persistence so your documents will take less size and send less data when syncing.
## Query API & Operators
## Update API & Operators
## Synchronization
## Live Queries & Frontend Frameworks
Live queries features enable you to query a set of documents as an observable array. Meaning, that the query value will change once the database has been updated and any modification you do on the query result will also be reflected on the database. Think of it like a two-way data-binding but for databases.
